The goal of this project is to understand how code changes can be automatically built and packaged using a CI/CD workflow.\r Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, the pipeline runs automatically to install dependencies, build a Docker image, and push it to DockerHub.\r This project was developed as part of my learning journey in DevOps and cloud fundamentals.",
